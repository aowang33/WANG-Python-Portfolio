# Python Semester Project

This is my Python project repository, which contains multiple semester projects. The focus project in this repository is a Web application built using Streamlit. Below is the structure of this repository:

## Basic Streamlit App

- [Basic Streamlit App Repository](https://github.com/aowang33/WANG-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)
This app demonstrates how to load and display CSV data, and provides interactive filtering functionality. Users can filter the data by selecting different penguin species.

You can start the app by running the following command:
streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py

## Tidy Data Project

In the Tidy Data Project, I applied tidy data principles to clean and reshape a dataset of 2008 Olympics medalists. The project involved transforming the data using the melt() function and visualizing the number of medals won by each gender and event. It showcases my skills in data cleaning, transformation, and basic data visualization.

## Custom NER App
Link: 
- [NERStreamlitApp Repository](https://github.com/aowang33/WANG-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp)

The Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) App is a Streamlit-based web application that uses spaCy to recognize and highlight named entities in text. It allows users to:

Input text manually or upload .txt files

Add custom entity recognition rules using spaCy’s EntityRuler

Visualize recognized entities in real time with spaCy’s displacy

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate natural language processing (NLP) techniques into interactive applications. It complements my portfolio by showing how I can build user-friendly tools that combine machine learning with web development.

## Future Updates...
