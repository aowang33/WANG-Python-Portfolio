# Python Semester Project

This is my Python project repository, which contains multiple semester projects. The focus project in this repository is a Web application built using Streamlit. Below is the structure of this repository:

## Basic Streamlit App
This app demonstrates how to load and display CSV data, and provides interactive filtering functionality. Users can filter the data by selecting different penguin species.

You can start the app by running the following command:
cd basic_streamlit_app
streamlit run main.py

## Future Updates
