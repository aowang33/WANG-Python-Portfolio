# Python Semester Project

This is my Python project repository, which contains multiple semester projects. The focus project in this repository is a Web application built using Streamlit. Below is the structure of this repository:

## Basic Streamlit App
This app demonstrates how to load and display CSV data, and provides interactive filtering functionality. Users can filter the data by selecting different penguin species.

You can start the app by running the following command:
streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py

## Tidy Data Project
Link: Tidy Data Project Repository

In the Tidy Data Project, I applied tidy data principles to clean and reshape a dataset of 2008 Olympics medalists. The project involved transforming the data using the melt() function and visualizing the number of medals won by each gender and event. It showcases my skills in data cleaning, transformation, and basic data visualization.
